How do I approach designing software?
When designing software, I like to figure out a plan before starting the actual development. This requires reading the requirements until I fully understand the goals of the development, and usually creating a written outline or things I want to include.
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
I had no real design skills previous to this course. Working on the project in this course has helped me understand how to create shapes, colors, lighting, and even camera controls!

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Since we were tasked with taking a 2D image and creating a 3D version, I worked on each object one at a time. The goal was to finish each object as it's own segment.
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I believe working in segments is the best way to approach software development. If I were to work on multiple objects or portions of the project, I would probably end up messing some part of the code up, or getting myself confused.

How do I approach developing programs? <br/>
Figuring out a list of program requirements is key to development. A written list is ideal! Figuring out what functions will be necessary in the program is also very helpful, as we can create simple functions that can be reused over and over (such as the functions in this project).

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
Honestly, I don't normally make a list of needed functions, but I did this time as there were different shapes which all needed specific functions. I created functions for creating a cylinder, pyramid, plane, cubes, etc., so it would just be easier for me to understand what I needed to be successful!

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was used throughout the project development to figure out vertex points for the shape, such as pyramids and cylinders. Since a cylinder is created using a set amount of "steps", which basically determines how round the cylinder will be, we have to iterate through all of the steps to get accurate points.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
This project was very tough, but working on it throughout the course definitely helped. Throughout the course, my approach evolved while I leared new techniques, and how to code better. It is still rather messy (I could probably shorten some of the code and keep similar function together), so it is still a work in progress.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer Science is my major, and I want to learn as much as I can so I can pursue a career in CS. Learning the various fields can open up more opportunities for me; I believe learning things like thi course taught (graphics) can help me in the future, especially if I go into a field such as game design.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I think this course greatly helped me understand how coding works. I enjoyed creating functions and learning more about things such as arguments (I have been a little confused as to how these work). Knowing and learning throughout this course can make my educational pathway easier.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The knowledge i've learned in this course can help my professional pathway, especially if I go into that deals with graphics. i think, also, that just knowing how to apply the learned techniques can help me better understand what you can do with coding and programming.
